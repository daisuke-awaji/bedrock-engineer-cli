# 🧙 Bedrock Engineer (CLI)

Bedrock Engineer is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) to assist with software development tasks. This tool combines the capabilities of a large language model with practical file system operations, web search functionality and build/deploy features of AWS cloud resources.

This application is implemented in node.js based on the source code of super cool [Claude-Enginner](https://github.com/Doriandarko/claude-engineer), and supports various [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/bedrock/) models. It uses Bedrock's [Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html).

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/daisuke-awaji/bedrock-engineer
   cd bedrock-engineer
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up your API keys:

   Add your Tavily API keys at the start of the .env file:

## 🤖 Automode

Automode allows Bedrock to work autonomously on complex tasks. When in automode:

1. Bedrock sets clear, achievable goals based on your request.
2. It works through these goals one by one, using available tools as needed.
3. Bedrock provides regular updates on its progress.
4. Automode continues until goals are completed.

To use automode:

1. Type 'automode' when prompted for input.
2. Provide your request when prompted.
3. Bedrock will work autonomously, providing updates after each iteration.
